The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different variation. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
This project is done on deep learning algorithm for that we will be using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), take the image as an input and learn the various features of the image through filters.
Also, it will  also provide good results and high accuracy for image classification.
